  <h3 id="fm"> Film'ania Rating - 8.8/10</h3>
  <p>Brilliantly shot and edited to appear as a single take, every camera movement is intelligent and serves a purpose as the mission unfolds, because the edits are camouflaged behind them, combined with precise blocking. But well beyond the ingenuity of the one-take shot, the story keeps you on the edge of your seat. This is reflected in the performances as well, with both leads swapping the narrative focus from each other in meticulously planned storytelling beats. The performances of the two young leads Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay are engaging, as facets of their otherwise ordinary personalities come through. The mission is the key focus as the two soldiers make their way through increasingly dangerous situations. Along the way, they encounter key army personnel, played by a cameo row of British actors, including Andrew Scott, Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Richard Madden who put in brief, but impressive performances.</p>
  <p>The cinematography by Roger Deakins is mesmerising, choreographed and executed to perfection around the horrific elements of war. Some of the frames are visually breathtaking, and demand to be revisited to absorb everything they have to offer. Thomas Newman’s score escalates the experience to soaring heights. This film could easily sweep up all the technical awards at the Oscars this year. All these factors firmly put director Sam Mendes in the upper echelon of directors currently working today, if he wasn’t there already. ‘1917’ is tense, captivating, meticulous, horrifying and stirring – an exceptional achievement in filmmaking.</p>
