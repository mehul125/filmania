  <h3 id="fm"> Film'ania Rating - 6.8/10</h3>
  <p>I went into “The Babadook” under a kind of misapprehension. I’d heard a bit about the movie—it would have been difficult, as a working film reviewer to not have—but not orally, so I thought that the title was pronounced with a long “o” or even a sort of “u,” so it rhymed with “Luke,” or, more pertinently, an obscure Italian-American slang word that Robert De Niro uses in “Raging Bull,” that word being “mamaluke.” As in, “I look like a mamaluke.” “A WHAT?” “Like a mamaluke. Like the mamaluke of the year.” Under this misapprehension, I actually underestimated this horror movie, the debut feature written and directed by Australian filmmaker Jennifer Kent.</p>
  <p>Kent’s directorial strategy is a marvel. In the first half of the film, she tells the story through the increasingly bleary eyes of Amelia. Once the ostensibly nonexistent Babadook starts making himself known —most devastatingly in a car rearview mirror incident that provides one of the film’s most jarring and viscerally potent sequences—it becomes Amelia’s turn to play the part of the monster. The heretofore intractable Sam begins to come off as vulnerable as, duh, he actually IS, while Amelia’s animus toward her son takes on what you might call supernatural proportions.</p>
  <p>The hiding-in-the-dark entity called The Babadook is the most slippery kind of menace in contemporary horror: a metaphor for both the terrors of childhood and the terrors of parenting—particularly single parenting under a very vexed circumstance—that’s also, within the created world of the film, a very real thing. This movie has been compared to Stanley Kubrick’s “The Shining,” which has very similar themes and also played similar games with deliberately blurring the lines between the contents of the troubled characters’ psyches and the possibly supernatural evils out to do them harm. In the end, “The Babadook” puts its chips on ending up as a more conventional horror movie—whatever the Babadook is, it’s something, finally—and that’s all to the good as far as I’m concerned. I like horror movies—they made me like movies in the first place, in fact—so seeing one as emotionally engaged, consistently gripping, beautifully constructed and paced, and really hella scary (without mind-numbing sadism but WITH a fair amount of grisly imagery) feels like a blessing.</p>
