  <h3 id="fm"> Film'ania Rating - 8.4/10</h3>
  <p>For movies like A Quiet Place – science fiction-based horror films that aren’t obsessed with appealing to the Blumhouse demographic – tone and atmosphere are the most critical production aspects. This is something Ridley Scott understood as far back as Alien, a film whose influence on A Quiet Place is evident. By emphasizing the “quiet” element of the title and thereby amplifying the impact of even the faintest of sounds, director/co-writer/star John Krasinski puts us on edge. Silence at times becomes claustrophobic, feeding into the escalating suspense that fuels the movie’s forceful and effective audience manipulation. Don’t be fooled by the PG-13 rating – A Quiet Place has an adult aesthetic and younger viewers may be unprepared for its unconventional style and unrelenting intensity.

Krasinski’s screenplay (a re-write of a script penned by Bryan Woods and Scott Beck) uses an economy of images (primarily newspaper headlines) to establish the backstory. They year is 2020 and we’re informed via a caption that whatever is happening has been happening for about three months. The “whatever” turns out to be an alien invasion. Unfriendly extraterrestrials have attacked and conquered, leaving isolated bands of humans to survive in near-silence. Since the aliens hunt by sound and apparently have no vision, quietness is paramount. Any loud noise can bring them, and they attack with such swiftness and ferocity that neither fighting nor fleeing represents a viable option.</p>
  <p>The use of American Sign Language allows the characters to communicate without speaking. Adding a layer to the importance of silence is the deafness of the oldest Abbott child; several scenes are presented from her perspective and, for those, Krasinski blots out all sound, bathing the theater in stillness. (Actress Millicent Simmonds, the girl from the silent-film portions of Wonderstruck, is deaf in real-life, fulfilling Krasinski’s requirement that Regan be played by a non-hearing actress.) Marco Beltrami’s musical score is understated, adding slight emphasis to certain scenes without ruining the carefully controlled sound design and editing.

A Quiet Place is an expertly made “refrigerator movie.” Although gripping, compelling, and exhausting as it unspools, there are a number of logical inconsistencies that emerge post-screening for those who care to put it under the microscope. This is commonly the case with horror films and even the best of the genre aren’t immune. (Why, oh why, did Jamie Lee Curtis throw away the knife in Halloween?) Narrative hiccups of this sort don’t reduce what Krasinski has achieved here. A Quiet Place is a superb exercise in understated terror that puts to shame “horror” films that rely on jump scares and cheap theatrics.</p>
