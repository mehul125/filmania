  <p>The abusive male himself might be unseen, but the fear he spreads is in plain sight in “The Invisible Man,” Leigh Whannell’s sophisticated sci-fi-horror that dares to turn a woman’s often silenced trauma from a toxic relationship into something unbearably tangible. Charged by a constant psychological dread that surpasses the ache of any visible bruise, Whannell’s ingenious genre entry amplifies the pain of its central character Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss) at every turn, making sure that her visceral scars sting like our own. Sometimes, to an excruciating degree.</p>
  <p>It's not an easy feat to accomplish. Partly because Whannell’s playground has its boundaries set within a pre-existing property that ought to be handled with care—James Whale’s circa 1933 pre-code classic, adapted from H.G. Wells’ 1897 novel—that is, if we learned anything from various lackluster studio remakes of recent years. But mostly because we are in the era of #MeToo, with the once-protected monsters of the real world finally being exposed for what they are, their terrorizing powers examined in stupendous films like Kitty Green’s “The Assistant”—a long-delayed revolution that shouldn’t be cheapened or misused. Thankfully, the Australian writer/director behind the wildly successful “Saw” and “Insidious” franchises, comes equipped with both sufficient visual panache—“The Invisible Man” recalls David Fincher’s Bay Area-set masterwork “Zodiac” and the mazy quality of James Cameron’s spine-tingling “Terminator 2: Judgment Day” when you least expect it—and fresh ideas to fashion the classic Universal Movie Monster with timeless and timely anxieties. And he does so in startlingly well-considered ways, updating something familiar with an inventive take. </p>
  <p>The certified contemporary queen of unhinged screen heroines—just consider “Her Smell,” “The Handmaid’s Tale,” “Us” and the upcoming “Shirley” collectively—Moss excels in these creepy scenes with her signature verve. As Cecilia who resourcefully fights an undetectable authority that ruins her life and controls her psychological wellbeing, Moss continues to deliver what we crave from woman characters: the kind of messy yet sturdy intricacy many of today’s thinly conceived you-go-girl female superheroes continue to lack. Whannell’s script and direction generously allow Moss the room to stretch those complex, varied muscles, while casually winking at an empowered final girl for this side of the 21st century.</p>
