  <h3 id="fm"> Film'ania Rating - 7.2/10</h3>
  <p>The tale is set on the last day of school, on the eve of graduation, in a posh suburb of Los Angeles. It’s centered on a pair of high-achieving high-school seniors, Molly (Beanie Feldstein) and Amy (Kaitlyn Dever), who appear to be the only two serious and ambitious students among a bunch of socialites and slackers. Even on the last morning of high school, they noodge Principal Brown (Jason Sudeikis) to join them in some student-government-related administrative work (Molly is class president), prompting him to cheerfully throw them out of his office; they go to a teacher, Miss Fine (Jessica Williams), who’s also their crossword-puzzle companion, and make plans to stay in touch while they’re in college. Molly is heading to Yale and Amy is going to Columbia; both envision careers in public service (Molly has decided that she’ll be the youngest Supreme Court Justice in history). But they don’t know where their classmates are going—the class has agreed not to talk about it amongst themselves, in order not to hurt anyone’s feelings.</p>
