  <h3 id="fm"> Film'ania Rating - 6.8/10</h3>
  <p>On August 10th, Universal Pictures cancelled the release of the Blumhouse production “The Hunt,” directed by Craig Zobel. The script for the film, about rich people who hunt poor people for sport, leaked and Trump supporters missed its subtext, calling it an invitation for blue state liberals to come after conservatives with guns. The problems with this are too numerous to explain in the preface to a film review but suffice it to say Universal made a bad call. By keeping the film from the public they’ve left it to our imagination exactly how anti-Trump the film is or isn’t. What they’ve also done is set a dangerous precedent. If Republicans decide a movie is unfair (and a goodly sum of major studio product is politically to the left by default these days) all The President need do is tweet about it and that film will be shelved. We can all be grateful then that no one had a hard look at “Ready Or Not,” a film implicitly as radical as "The Hunt." Which is to say neither film is going to change the way anyone votes, but they both posit a game in which the rich hunt the poor. “Ready or Not” doesn’t wear its anti-capitalist bias proudly but you’d have to be blind to miss it.</p>
  <p>Weaving’s expressiveness lends her plight instant pathos and Brody, who’s been one of America’s best character actors for over a decade, slowly pulling back from the rest of the clan, plays nicely against the bug-eyed fervor of the rest of the Le Domas’ brood. By the time the games come to an end, “Ready or Not" has ceased to be about the rich and the poor. It’s about a girl trying to survive a violent ordeal, which is potent enough for the moment you’re watching the film, but in a climate in which politics can pull a film from a release schedule, now is not the time to hide. </p>
