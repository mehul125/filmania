  <h3 id="fm"> Film'ania Rating - 6.7/10</h3>
  <p>Pokemon is one of the world’s highest-grossing media franchises. From its wildly popular video game iterations to soft toys and merchandise, Pokemon’s monster success back in the 90’s launched a surprisingly decent and faithful anime adaptation that’s continued to captivate kids and young adults alike. Armed with a host of colourful Pokemon, a simple story that stayed true to the premise of the games and an enigmatic trio of characters at the centre of this tale, Pokemon’s anime success is unrivaled. Moving into 2020 and marking the 23rd season of Pokemon action, Pokemon strikes a new deal with Netflix to bring the action to this streaming platform. </p>

From its wildly popular video game iterations to soft toys and merchandise, Pokemon’s monster success back in the 90’s launched a surprisingly decent and faithful anime adaptation that’s continued to captivate kids and young adults alike. Armed with a host of colourful Pokemon, a simple story that stayed true to the premise of the games and an enigmatic trio of characters at the centre of this tale, Pokemon’s anime success is unrivaled. Moving into 2020 and marking the 23rd season of Pokemon action, Pokemon strikes a new deal with Netflix to bring the action to this streaming platform. </p>
  <p>The first 12 episodes that make up part 1 hops across numerous regions as Ash sets out on his journey to catch Pokemon. At the same time, Gou becomes determined to catch the mysterious Mew whom he encounters early on in the show. From here, the series essentially weaves both these character journeys together and across the first 12 episodes of this anime, builds up to a climax that leaves things wide open for the second part to come.

Aesthetically, Pokemon Journeys looks gorgeous. The hand-drawn animation is bright, vivid and well-animated, staying true to all those old Poke-quips as cutaway screens and exaggerated faces are a mainstay to keep the comedy high for kids. With over 900 different Pokemon creatures to choose from now, the artists absolutely make the most of that gold mine and feature a whole range of different monsters dotted throughout the episodes.

The actual core of each episode remains the same though although Team Rocket are used very sparingly. Their little back-and-forth introduction is a nice inclusion for when they do show up and their self-awareness has a nice touch of irony. It’s not the end of the world of course but their light use here feels more like a nod toward fans of old rather than a meaningful piece of storytelling.</p>
<p>With the sheer amount of Pokemon thrown into this, the episodes can feel a little busy and at times there’s a feel that the show is ticking boxes and trying to add every single creature before season’s end. That’s not necessarily a bad thing of course but when Lugia, Mew, Houou and other rare species all show up across the first 12 episodes, it does lose some of that magic this had in earlier seasons where seeing these Pokemon ended up as an epic and rare moment.

It should be obvious by now though that Pokemon Journeys is primarily designed for kids. It’s a show that’s constantly evolved over time but managed to reinvent itself to appeal to a whole new audience along the way. The visuals look great, the reset story manages to balance the old with the new and along the way Pokemon Journeys does its best to keep both new and existing fans happy. With a big cliffhanger ending and plenty to chew through, much like Ash and Gou, Netflix and Pokemon may just prove to be the perfect team going forward.</p>
