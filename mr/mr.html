  <h3 id="fm"> Film'ania Rating - 7.1/10</h3>
  <p>During the heyday of the network sitcom, standard operating procedure was to take a highly successful stand-up comedian, put them in the lead role of a sitcom that allowed them to basically do their act week in and week out, print money and repeat. But, as television evolved with a focus on single-cam comedy, this business model began to fade. Now, Netflix seeks to bring it back from the depths with its newest multi-cam, Mr. Iglesias.

Starring comedian Gabriel Iglesias, Mr. Iglesias follows the life of high school history teacher, Gabe, as he attempts to keep his kids in line as the school they attend tries everything it can to remove them from the student body in order to increase district performance.</p>
<p>In the beginning, you’re lead to believe this is going to be a season about Gabriel teaching summer school in order to save his students from being expelled. But, then, in the second episode, we begin at the end of that story and move into the new school year. It’s a very jarring jump, and not the only one. But, once past that awkward transition, the show really comes into its own by the third episode.

PROMOTED

Overall, we kind of have to hand it to Mr. Iglesias, starring Gabriel “Fluffy” Iglesias (which is his actual screen credit in the series). It works. It's funny. It's cute. Is it gonna change the game? No. Is it gonna be the next One Day at a Time? Absolutely not. But, is it worth survival? Yes. Yes, it is.</p>
