  <p>“Doctor Sleep” is the continuation of Danny Torrance’s story 40 years after the terrifying events of Stephen King’s The Shining. Still irrevocably scarred by the trauma he endured as a child at the Overlook, Dan Torrance has fought to find some semblance of peace. But that peace is shattered when he encounters Abra, a courageous teenager with her own powerful extrasensory gift, known as the “shine.” Instinctively recognizing that Dan shares her power, Abra has sought him out, desperate for his help against the merciless Rose the Hat and her followers, The True Knot, who feed off the shine of innocents in their quest for immortality. Forming an unlikely alliance, Dan and Abra engage in a brutal life-or-death battle with Rose. Abra’s innocence and fearless embrace of her shine compel Dan to call upon his own powers as never before—at once facing his fears and reawakening the ghosts of the past.</p>
  <p>Parents need to know that Doctor Sleep is a horror movie adapted from a Stephen King novel; it's the official sequel to The Shining. Violence is quite intense: Children are shown in peril, screaming, and dying, and there are guns and shooting, fighting and punching, an ax fight, bloody wounds, gore, a sexual predator, and more. The naked ghost of an elderly woman is seen, a man wakes up naked in bed with a woman (his buttocks are shown, and she's shown from the side), and characters kiss. Language includes uses of "f--k," "s--t, "bitch," and more. The main character (Ewan McGregor) is an alcoholic who drinks, passes out, wakes up in unfamiliar places, and vomits. He eventually goes to AA meetings and quits. A woman snorts cocaine. Directed by Mike Flanagan, the film can't compare to Stanley Kubrick's original, but, despite the upsetting violence toward kids, it's a well-made, involving sequel for mature viewers.
