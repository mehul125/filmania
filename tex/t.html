  <h3 id="fm"> Film'ania Rating - 8/10</h3>
  <p>During the cold months of the winter of 1973-74, the release of a horror film called The Exorcist became a national phenomenon. Would-be viewers stood outside for hours in bad weather to get a ticket, and the lines in New York City were said to circle entire blocks. Although this kind of fervor was not unprecedented, it was unexpected. As recently as several months before the movie's release, Warner Brothers had been discussing shelving the entire project. The distributor's ultimate willingness to take a chance returned huge financial dividends and established one of the most frequently copied films about demonic possession.

Now, 27 years later, Warner Brothers has decided to re-release The Exorcist, attempting to entice viewers to theaters by touting a digitally updated soundtrack (one that is very impressive) and about 12 minutes of "never before seen footage" (a misnomer - owners of the 25th anniversary Special Edition DVD will recognize many of the deleted scenes from the included documentary). The timing is odd - not many films are given at theatrical re-release for their 27th anniversary. Rumor has it that the intent here was to generate new interest in The Exorcist so that a third sequel (actually a prequel) will not die without a trace when it reaches theaters next year.</p>
  <p>The story is based on a series of true events that occurred in 1949 and were later fictionalized by author William Peter Blatty in his novel. It tells of the demonic possession of 12-year old Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair), the daughter of popular actress Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn). When we first meet Regan, she seems like any happy, well-adjusted girl. Soon, however, she is hearing strange noises, uttering obscenities, and experiencing violent tantrums and seizures. As her condition worsens and she begins speaking in an inhuman voice (provided by Mercedes McCambridge), the army of attending doctors advises calling in spiritual help. So Chris consults a local priest (who also happens to be a psychiatrist), Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller). After examining Regan, he agrees to assist in an exorcism, which will be performed by the respected and mysterious globe-trotting priest, Father Merrin (von Sydow).

The film develops parallel storylines that eventually converge during the exorcism as Regan struggles against the spirit that has taken over her body and Father Karras confronts his own personal demons. This portion of the film, with the two priests engaging in a metaphysical battle against a force of evil, represents The Exorcist's undeniable high point. The confrontation is tense and intense, and, until it's over, we're never sure what the outcome is going to be. Having employed several priests as actors and advisors, Friedkin and Blatty remained true to the nature and intent of Catholicism (still, one has to wonder how today's vocal Catholic League would have reacted to the movie had they been active in 1973), never mocking the religion or its tenets. In fact, in order to accept the events that occur during The Exorcist, one has to buy into certain elements of Catholicism, at least while the movie is unspooling.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how The Exorcist fares during its re-release. The film has not changed substantially, but audiences have. Reports from 1973 speak of viewers fleeing from the movie in shock and of stunned silence reigning throughout packed theaters. One generation later, much is different and movie-goers have become desensitized to the kinds of images presented in The Exorcist. At a screening I attended, the 360-degree revolution of Linda Blair's head provoked laughter; indeed, there were instances when audience members seemed to view the film as an exercise in high camp. However, regardless of how movie-goers react, there is nothing dated about The Exorcist, which remains an effective excursion into demonic possession more than a quarter of a century after it was first unveiled to the public.</p>
