  <h3 id="fm"> Film'ania Rating - 6.1/10</h3>
  <p>The reviews are in, and for the most part, critics and average viewers alike have panned Space Force, the high-profile Steve Carell/Greg Daniels comedy with a truly stacked cast that arrived on Netflix this weekend with a thud.

Critics have scored it a 39% on Rotten Tomatoes, dismally low both for a Netflix original but really for any TV shows generally, as you rarely see much below a 60% on television there. Fans have given it a 6.9/10 on IMDB which sounds better, but that curve means that compared to other Netflix originals, it’s something like the 156th highest rated program/film from the service, which is nothing to brag about. At best, I’m seeing some pushes back of “actually, Space Force isn’t as bad as people say” which is hardly glowing praise. I still have not managed to bring myself to watch more than the pilot, as it…did not inspire further investigation on my end.</p>
<p>Netflix has made it pretty easy to see which of its shows will be back for more ever since they debuted the new Top 10 list on the site. We have repeatedly seen debut shows appear there, land at #1-3, stay in the Top 10 for a week or two, and then promptly get renewed. I’m having trouble thinking of shows that have followed this pattern and not been picked back up, frankly, outside of some just-arrivedofferings, but I’d expect to hear a show like Sweet Magnolias is getting picked up for season 2 after its success this past week, just like Outer Banks did before that. They’re all following the same pattern. Shows that don’t make this list during their debut or fall off immediately? They might be in more trouble.</p>
<p>It would also give Space Force a chance to course-correct, no pun intended. To figure out what works (John Malkovitch) and what doesn’t (almost everything else) and make a better show for season 2. I have heard frequent comparisons to The Office and Parks and Recreation, which both struggled to find solid ground in their first seasons, but season 2 and beyond became all-time classics. While I think Space Force is fundamentally worse than season 1 of either of those shows, I do agree that it could have the potential to get better if given another shot. And I am almost positive that Netflix will give it one. Stay tuned for that announcement shortly, I’d imagine.</p>
