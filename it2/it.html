  <h3 id="fm"> Film'ania Rating - 6.6/10</h3>
  <p>Multiple “wow” moments permeate the landscape of “It Chapter Two” like so many ominous, red balloons floating across a New England summer sky.

Some will make you say “wow” for the sheer daring of their surrealism and the startlingly graphic nature of their execution. Others will make you say “wow” because they really do not work. Either way, director Andy Muschietti has absolutely gone for it with the sequel to his 2017 smash Stephen King adaptation, taking big swings and displaying both a muscularity and an elegance to his craft.</p>
<p>First, though, the members of the Losers Club must spread out across town and find totems from their youth as part of a ritual to purge Pennywise from existence; they do it at Mike’s insistence, part of the Native American subplot that also exists in the source material. It’s absurd and it’s a distraction; excising this element of the story would have made the film as a whole leaner and stronger. But while separating the characters significantly lengthens the running time, it also results in individual moments of insane terror, most notably the expertly staged and paced scene in which Beverly revisits her childhood apartment. What she finds there is one of those “wow” moments—you’ll laugh out loud in hopes of alleviating some of the excruciating suspense.</p>
<p>Eventually, though, you’ll also come to realize that Pennywise gets a little repetitive with the frights he inflicts upon his victims. They’re of a few varieties: They’re staggering, slurping zombies, or they’re somehow spider-related, or they involve gallons of water or blood. (Henry Bowers [Teach Grant/Nicholas Hamilton], the mulleted bully from the first film, also returns to do his cruel bidding in a way that feels contrived and superfluous.) But as “It Chapter Two” shows us, not only can you go home again—you sorta have to. </p>
