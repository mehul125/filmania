  <h3 id="fm"> Film'ania Rating - 8.8/10</h3>
  <p>Johannes Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis) is nicknamed ‘Jojo Rabbit’ at the Hitler Youth Camp since he is considered a coward for not being to kill a rabbit, as part of the training process. In an attempt to prove otherwise, he takes a wild shot with a hand grenade, which explodes scarring his face and crippling a leg. The camp is run by Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell), who fondly remembers his days at war before he was injured and relegated to training young Nazi boys, and his associate Fraulein Rahm (Rebel Wilson).</p>
  <p>Disappointed that he wasn’t able to live up to his own expectations and with his father away at war, Jojo turns to his imaginary friend, 'Adolf Hitler' (Taika Waititi), for encouragment. Jojo’s already established fanatic beliefs and indoctrination are further fuelled by this friend’s pep talks.</p>
  <p>While 'Jojo Rabbit' is in many ways a coming-of-age film, with its satirical stance it is also an audacious one. It's a film that hits hard and makes for an overwhelming cinematic experience with the mix of conflicting emotions that it throws open.</p>
