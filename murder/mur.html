  <p>Annalise Keating gave her closing statements in more ways than one in the HTGAWM series finale.

They did it, guys! They finally got away with murder, once and for all. It wasn’t easy, and it certainly wasn’t without consequences. The journey was beautiful and horrifying, and some might even say it wasn’t worth it. But one thing is for sure. It’s over.</p>
<p>The HTGAWM series finale both honored and deviated from the show’s usual formula by containing its rapid rewinds and flash forwards within the episode. Before we even got to hear Annalise’s closing arguments we knew that no matter what, things weren’t going to end well. I’m sure I’m not the only one who changed the context of Annalise’s funeral in my brain when I heard those gun shots. After six seasons of chaos, HTGAWM couldn’t just let things end peacefully!

In true HTGAWM fashion, I’ll get back to that, and rewind back to the beginning of the episode. Although a lot of this episode took place in the courtroom, it wasn’t the final courtroom battle that I expected.

I so badly wanted to see Annalise go head-to-head with her accusers and take them down, once and for all. I wanted the episode to end with Governor Birkhead and half of the FBI in handcuffs, with Annalise being carried out of the trial by her supporters and cheered by her oppressors, because even they couldn’t deny how thoroughly the queen slayed. It’s been such a long fight against the governor, and I wanted Annalise to be the one to wipe that politician smirk off of her face.</p>
<p>I really liked this touch because it makes me feel like everything is really okay. Everyone has been able to move on and find happiness to the point that this class that led them to so much pain can begin anew as a positive thing.

That’s about as perfect of an ending as I can think of for the HTGAWM characters, especially with Annalise smiling down on Christopher as he taught, indicating that she had remained a big part of his life. There’s a lot of beauty in that, and I’m really glad that HTGAWM went out on that note.</p>
