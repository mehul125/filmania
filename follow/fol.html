  <h3 id="fm"> Film'ania Rating - 6.8/10</h3>
  <p>If you look at the title of "It Follows," an unsettling, and deservedly celebrated new horror film, and can't tell what the movie is about, then the movie is already working. "It Follows," the second feature by writer/director David Robert Mitchell ("The Myth of the American Sleepover"), works as well as it does because its creators keep viewers at arm's length. It's a ghost story, though dead people don’t necessarily haunt its suburban protagonists. And it's about teenagers who have sex, though it's neither a simple celebration nor condemnation of under-age necking. Instead, "It Follows" both prolongs and heightens the potency of high school-age fears until they appear to be ancient existential terrors. In that sense, "It Follows" is not really about sex, but an unbearable, unsinkable mood that descends when you come of age, and never completely dissipates, not even after climactic sexual, or other violent acts. </p>
  <p>Don't panic: "It Follows" is not nearly as obtuse as it sounds. If anything, it's a little frustrating in its limited view of kids that are always concerned with, but never really thinking about sex. Jay and her friends take for granted the fact that they're living in a constant state of excitement. That's a given, so Mitchell doesn't exoticize, or exaggerate that aspect of their characters. He does, however, refuse to explain what Jay feels when she's pursued by various pale, zombie-like followers. Jay's not really introspective, so she only cursorily talks about her naive pre-sexual expectations. All we know is that she expects sex to be momentous and/or freeing, as she airily says to herself after she and Hugh fool around. Instead, it's a momentary respite that's inevitably followed by a series of confrontations with people she may or may not know (aka adulthood).</p>
  <p>That kind of primordial dread is embedded in the film's visual style. Mitchell's camera visually unifies the characters' shared world, either through static panoramas that show several characters occupying the same space, or tracking shots and/or pans that follow characters from one end of the room to the other. We're also given the impression of infinite space whenever Mitchell's camera stands in for, or is positioned inside Paul or Jay's cars. In these scenes, the road that stretches out in front of them/us is long, and there is never a set destination in sight. That concept is far more unnerving than any of the film's more traditional scare scenes, though those are pretty good too (don't look at me, experience them for yourself). No, what's most disquieting about "It Follows" is the way it presents sex as neither abnormal, nor beneficial. By contrast, sex in "It Follows" indiscriminately draws pre-existing emotions out, like a cruel genie that can never be returned to his lamp. </p>
